  <string name="enumsmatter_description">A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…\n\n\nDevelopers of the <b>Android
    Framework</b> refrained from using enums, because of their impact on the runtime and the SDK size.
    When you write code <b>shared by thousands of apps</b> and running all day long on millions of devices in an event loop,
    you better squeeze all the performance bits you can.\n\n
    For mysterious reasons, a few jokesters started advocating that app developers follow the same logic.
    We got 99 perf problems but <b>enums ain\'t one</b>. As a reaction, the community created the
    <i>#enumsmatter</i> hashtag to remind ourselves that it\'s OK to write sane code.
